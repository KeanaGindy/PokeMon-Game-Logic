# ser316-spring-B-code-a-mon

To create the code-a-mon implementation, I will use the following decorator patterns
- Decorator Pattern: used for evolutions to overwrite and add behavior
- Factory Pattern: used to build new code-a-mon or trainers
- Mediator Pattern: used because the simulation will be tick based
- Strategy Pattern: used to check damage of a code-a-mon
